# List.TransformMany


## Description

Returns a list whose elements are transformed from the input list using specified functions.


## Syntax

```powerquery
List.TransformMany(
    list as list,
    collectionTransform as function,
    resultTransform as function
) as list
```


## Details

Returns a list whose elements are projected from the input list.<br />    <br />    The <code>collectionTransform</code> function transforms each element into an intermediate list, and the <code>resultTransform</code> function receives the original element as well as an item from the intermediate list in order to construct the final result.<br />    <br />    The <code>collectionTransform</code> function has the signature <code>(x as any) as list => ...</code>, where <code>x</code> is an element in <code>list</code>.    The <code>resultTransform</code> function projects the shape of the result and has the signature <code>(x as any, y as any) as any => ...</code>, where <code>x</code> is an element in <code>list</code> and <code>y</code> is an element from the list generated by passing <code>x</code> to <code>collectionTransform</code>.


## Examples

### Example #1 
Flatten a list of people and their pets.
```powerquery
List.TransformMany(
    {
        [Name = "Alice", Pets = {"Scruffy", "Sam"}],
        [Name = "Bob", Pets = {"Walker"}]
    },
    each [Pets],
    (person, pet) => [Name = person[Name], Pet = pet]
)
```

Result: 
```powerquery
{
    [Name = "Alice", Pet = "Scruffy"],
    [Name = "Alice", Pet = "Sam"],
    [Name = "Bob", Pet = "Walker"]
}
```
