# List.Generate


Generates a list of values.


## Syntax

```powerquery
List.Generate(
    initial as function,
    condition as function,
    next as function,
    optional selector as function
) as list
```


## Remarks

Generates a list of values using the provided functions. The <code>initial</code> function generates a starting candidate value, which is then tested against <code>condition</code>.    If the candidate value is approved, then it's returned as part of the resulting list, and the next candidate value is generated by passing the newly approved value to <code>next</code>.    Once a candidate value fails to match <code>condition</code>, the list generation process stops.    An optional parameter, <code>selector</code>, may also be provided to transform the items in the resulting list.


## Examples

### Example #1 
Create a list by starting at ten, repeatedly decrementing by one, and ensuring each item is greater than zero.
```powerquery
List.Generate(() => 10, each _ > 0, each _ - 1)
```

Result: 
```powerquery
{10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
```


### Example #2 
Generate a list of records containing x and y, where x is a value and y is a list. x should remain less than 10 and represent the number of items in the list y. After the list is generated, return only the x values.
```powerquery
List.Generate(
    () => [x = 1, y = {}],
    each [x] < 10,
    each [x = List.Count([y]), y = [y] & {x}],
    each [x]
)
```

Result: 
```powerquery
{1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
```
